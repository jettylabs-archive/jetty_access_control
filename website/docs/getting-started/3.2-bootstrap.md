# Bootstrap your Configuration

## Jetty Bootstrap

With a project set up, Jetty can now fetch the relevant metadata from your configured connectors with the `jetty bootstrap command`.

:::info ACTION
To begin this process, move into your project directory and run:

```
jetty bootstrap
```

:::

The time it takes for `bootstrap` to run will vary based on your data infrastructure, but will typically take well under a minute. Once this is complete, it would probably be a great time to create your first commit using the git repository that `jetty new` set up for you.

The bootstrapping process uses the APIs and configurations of your connected systems to understand users, groups, lineage, and access permissions. This information is then used to populate configuration files and the [explore](../cli/explore) interface.

:::tip Updating metadata
Bootstrapping usually run only once for a project. After the initial run, you can update Jetty's representation of your environment by running `jetty fetch`. This will not update your configuration files (other than adding files for new users and assets), so it won't overwrite any changes you've made.

If you want to start over, you can run `jetty bootstrap -o` to overwrite your existing config files.

## Project Layout

Once your project is created and bootstrapped, it will have the following layout:

```text

Project Name
  ├── .data  # This directory holds Jetty's state data
  │    ├── jetty_graph  # A serialized representation of your environment created by `jetty fetch`
  │    └── {connector}  # A directory where connectors are allowed to store connector-specific state
  │         └── {connector-specific data}
  │
  ├── .git  # The git repository for the project
  │    └── ...
  │
  ├── .schema  # JSON Schemas for configuration files
  │    ├── assets.json
  │    ├── groups.json
  │    ├── users.json
  │    └── config.json  # A generated schema that includes project-specific validation
  │
  ├── .vscode  # VSCode settings for the project
  │    └── settings.json  # Settings for the VSCode YAML plugin to enable config linting and autocomplete
  │
  ├── groups
  │    └── groups.yaml  # Configuration file mapping groups and their hierarchy
  ├── tags
  │    └── tags.yaml    # Configuration file defining tags
  ├── users
  │    ├── <name>.yaml  # Configuration files for each user in the system (files can be renamed)
  │    └── ...
  ├── assets
  │    └── <folder mirroring your infrastructure>
  │         └── <asset name>.yaml  # Configuration files for every asset in your environment (files can be renamed)
  │
  └── jetty_config.yaml  # The Jetty project configuration
```

Now that your configurations have been bootstrapped, your read yto start making some changes!
