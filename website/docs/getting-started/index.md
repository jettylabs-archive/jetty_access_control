# Getting Started with Jetty

## Welcome

In this guide, we'll show you everything you need to know to get started with data access control in Jetty. By the end of this guide you will know how to:

- Install Jetty
- Connect to your existing data stack
- Create a base configuration
- Explore your data access policies
- Create and apply new policies
- Audit your data access rights
- Validate your policies with custom tests

:::note

In this walk-through, we will connect to Snowflake, dbt, and Tableau. If those aren't your tools of choice, the tutorial will still be the best introduction to Jetty (and you can even use our demo credentials).

You can refer to the [Connectors](../connectors/index.md) section for details on connecting to other tools.

This tutorial is intended to demonstrate the basics of how the system works. You can find more detailed instructions about individual capabilities in the [Guides](../guides/index.md) section of the documentation.

Now let's go ahead and start using Jetty!
