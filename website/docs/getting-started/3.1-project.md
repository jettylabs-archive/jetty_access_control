# Create a New Project

Jetty is configured via projects. Projects store information about your data infrastructure and are the central repository for user-managed configurations, such as tag definitions.

## Jetty Init

To create and configure a new project, open your terminal and run

```
jetty init
```

The init prompts will help you connect Jetty to Snowflake, dbt, and/or Tableau, and then will set up a new directory for your project.

:::tip
Jetty only stores the login information you provide on your local machine. The saved information can be reviewed and modified at `~/.jetty/connectors.yaml`. The Jetty project directory itself is safe to be tracked and shared via version control tools like git.
:::

Once you complete the `jetty init` flow, you are ready to fetch and explore the access control metadata from your environment.

## Jetty Add

After running `jetty init`, you can add additional connectors by running

```
jetty add
```

The add prompts are similar to those of `jetty init` and will add the specified connectors to your existing configuration files.
