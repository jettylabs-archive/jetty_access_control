# Create a New Project

## Jetty New

Jetty is configured via projects. Projects store information about your data infrastructure and are the central repository for user-managed configurations, and can be created with the `jetty new` CLI command.

:::info ACTION
Create a Jetty project by opening your terminal, navigating to the directory where you would like your project to be created and running:

```
jetty new
```

:::

The prompts will help you connect Jetty to Snowflake, dbt, and/or Tableau, and then will set up a new version-controlled directory for your project. If you want to add another connector to your project later, you can just run `jetty add`.

:::info Keeping your credentials safe
Jetty only stores the login information you provide on your local machine. The saved information can be reviewed and modified at `~/.jetty/connectors.yaml`. The Jetty project directory doesn't contain this information and is safe to be tracked and shared via version control tools like git.
:::

Once you complete the `jetty new` flow, you are ready to generate your configuration files from your environment.
