# Installation

Jetty operates via a command-line interface that can be installed with `pip`, the Python package manager.

:::note
To install Jetty on your local computer, make sure that you have Python 3.7+ and pip installed. While not required we also recommend installing Jetty in a virtual environment.
:::

To install Jetty, open your terminal and run

```python
pip install jetty-core
```

Next, run `jetty` in the terminal. You should see information about the Jetty CLI.

:::tip
If it's not working for you, open a new terminal window and try running `jetty` again. If it's still not working, [send us a note](mailto:support@get-jetty.com).
